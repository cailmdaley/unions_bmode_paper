     abstract = "{We constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy-bias parameters using
        the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing
        measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) year-3 data. We
        describe our modeling framework and choice of scales analyzed,
        validating their robustness to theoretical uncertainties in
        small-scale clustering by analyzing simulated data. Using a
        linear galaxy-bias model and redMaGiC galaxy sample, we obtain
        10\% constraints on the matter density of the Universe. We also
        implement a nonlinear galaxy-bias model to probe smaller scales
        that includes parametrization based on hybrid perturbation
        theory and find that it leads to a 17\% gain in cosmological
        constraining power. We perform robustness tests of our
        methodology pipeline and demonstrate stability of the
        constraints to changes in the theory model. Using the redMaGiC
        galaxy sample as foreground lens galaxies and adopting the best-
        fitting cosmological parameters from DES year-1 data, we find
        the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements to
        exhibit significant signals akin to decorrelation between
        galaxies and mass on large scales, which is not expected in any
        current models. This likely systematic measurement error biases
        our constraints on galaxy bias and the S$_{8}$ parameter. We
        find that a scale-, redshift- and sky-area-independent
        phenomenological decorrelation parameter can effectively capture
        this inconsistency between the galaxy clustering and galaxy-
        galaxy lensing. We trace the source of this correlation to a
        color-dependent photometric issue and minimize its impact on our
        result by changing the selection criteria of redMaGiC galaxies.
        Using this new sample, our constraints on the S$_{8}$ parameter
        are consistent with previous studies and we find a small shift
        in the {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ constraints compared to the
        fiducial redMaGiC sample. We infer the constraints on the mean
        host-halo mass of the redMaGiC galaxies in this new sample from
        the large-scale bias constraints, finding the galaxies occupy
        halos of mass approximately 1.6 {\texttimes}{}10$^{13}$

     abstract = "{We present the first cosmology results from large-scale structure using
        the full 5000 deg$^{2}$ of imaging data from the Dark Energy
        Survey (DES) Data Release 1. We perform an analysis of large-
        scale structure combining three two-point correlation functions
        (3 {\texttimes}2 pt ): (i) cosmic shear using 100 million source
        galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the cross-
        correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions,
        galaxy-galaxy lensing. To achieve the cosmological precision
        enabled by these measurements has required updates to nearly
        every part of the analysis from DES Year 1, including the use of
        two independent galaxy clustering samples, modeling advances,
        and several novel improvements in the calibration of
        gravitational shear and photometric redshift inference. The
        analysis was performed under strict conditions to mitigate
        confirmation or observer bias; we describe specific changes made
        to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the results
        and tests of the robustness of our results to this decision. We
        model the data within the flat {\ensuremath{\Lambda}} CDM and w
        CDM cosmological models, marginalizing over 25 nuisance
        parameters. We find consistent cosmological results between the
        three two-point correlation functions; their combination yields
        clustering amplitude S$_{8}$=0.77 6$_{-0.017}$$^{+0.017}$ and
        matter density {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$=0.33

        parameter w =-0.9 8$_{-0.20}$$^{+0.32}$ in w CDM . These
        constraints correspond to an improvement in signal-to-noise of
        the DES Year 3 3 {\texttimes}2 pt data relative to DES Year 1 by
        a factor of 2.1, about 20\% more than expected from the increase
        in observing area alone. This combination of DES data is
        consistent with the prediction of the model favored by the
        Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy
        data, which is quantified with a probability-to-exceed p =0.13
        -0.48. We find better agreement between DES 3 {\texttimes}2 pt
        and Planck than in DES Y1, despite the significantly improved
        precision of both. When combining DES 3 {\texttimes}2 pt data
        with available baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift-space
        distortion, and type Ia supernovae data, we find p =0.34 .

        deg$^{2}$ of the northern sky with an effective galaxy number
        density of 15 arcmin$^{-2}$ over the four redshift bins. The

        $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} =

        ($0.73\sigma$) with results from the Planck Legacy cosmic
        microwave background experiment. The final KiDS footprint spans
        $1347$ square degrees of deep nine-band imaging across the
        optical and near-infrared, along with an extra $23$ square
        degrees of KiDS-like calibration observations of deep
        spectroscopic surveys. Improvements in our redshift distribution
        estimation methodology, combined with our enhanced calibration
        data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to extend our
        lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\rm
        B}\leq2.0$. Compared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased
        survey area and redshift depth results in a $\sim32\%$

        $\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^\alpha =

        optimised to match the revised degeneracy direction of
        $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We adopt a new physically
        motivated intrinsic alignment model that depends jointly on the
        galaxy sample's halo mass and spectral type distributions, and
        that is informed by previous direct alignment measurements. We
        also marginalise over our uncertainty on the impact of baryon
        feedback on the non-linear matter power spectrum. Comparing to
        previous KiDS analyses, we conclude that the increase seen in
        $S_8$ primarily results from our improved redshift distribution
        estimation and calibration, as well as new survey area and
        improved image reduction. Our companion paper St{\"o}lzner et

        particular attention to systematic effects which can introduce
        spurious spatial correlations in the source ellipticities. The
        most serious systematic effects are those produced by the
        anisotropy of the VLA beam, and by the spatial correlation of

        provides a powerful discriminant between lensing and intrinsic

        matter distribution in the Universe, has not only been detected
        by several groups, but the observational results have been used
        to derive constraints on cosmological parameters. For this
        purpose, several cosmic shear statistics have been employed. As
        shown recently, all second-order statistical measures can be
        expressed in terms of the two-point correlation functions of the
        shear, which thus represents the basic quantity; also, from a
        practical point-of-view, the two-point correlation functions are
        easiest to obtain from observational data which typically have
        complicated geometry. We derive in this paper expressions for
        the covariance matrix of the cosmic shear two-point correlation
        functions which are readily applied to any survey geometry.
        Furthermore, we consider the more special case of a simple
        survey geometry which allows us to obtain approximations for the
        covariance matrix in terms of integrals which are readily
        evaluated numerically. These results are then used to study the
        covariance of the aperture mass dispersion which has been
        employed earlier in quantitative cosmic shear analyses. We show
        that the aperture mass dispersion, measured at two different
        angular scales, quickly decorrelates with the ratio of the
        scales. Inverting the relation between the shear two-point
        correlation functions and the power spectrum of the underlying
        projected matter distribution, we construct estimators for the
        power spectrum and for the band powers, and show that they
        yields accurate approximations; in particular, the correlation
        between band powers at different wave numbers is quite weak. The
        covariance matrix of the shear correlation function is then used
        to investigate the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter
        estimates from cosmic shear surveys. Depending on the use of
        prior information, e.g. from CMB measurements, cosmic shear can
        yield very accurate determinations of several cosmological
        parameters, in particular the normalization sigma\_8 of the
        power spectrum of the matter distribution, the matter density
        parameter \{cal O\}mega\_m, and the shape parameter Gamma .}",

        studying the properties of dark energy in the Universe. As a
        standard method, the two-point correlation functions
        {\ensuremath{\xi}}\_{\ensuremath{\pm}}({\ensuremath{\vartheta}})
        of the cosmic shear field are used as statistical measures for
        the shear field. \textbackslash Aims: In order to separate the
        observed shear into E- and B-modes, the latter being most likely
        produced by remaining systematics in the data set and/or
        intrinsic alignment effects, several statistics have been
        defined before. Here we aim at a complete E-/B-mode
        decomposition of the cosmic shear information contained in the
        {\ensuremath{\xi}}\_{\ensuremath{\pm}} on a finite angular
        interval. \textbackslash Methods: We construct two sets of such
        E-/B-mode measures, namely Complete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-mode
        Integrals (COSEBIs), characterized by weight functions between
        the {\ensuremath{\xi}}\_{\ensuremath{\pm}} and the COSEBIs which
        are polynomials in {\ensuremath{\vartheta}} or polynomials in
        ln{\ensuremath{\vartheta}}, respectively. Considering the
        likelihood in cosmological parameter space, constructed from the
        COSEBIs, we study their information content. \textbackslash
        Results: We show that the information grows with the number of
        COSEBI modes taken into account, and that an asymptotic limit is
        reached which defines the maximum available information in the
        E-mode component of the {\ensuremath{\xi}}\_{\ensuremath{\pm}}.
        We show that this limit is reached the earlier (i.e., for a
        smaller number of modes considered) the narrower the angular
        range is over which {\ensuremath{\xi}}\_{\ensuremath{\pm}} are
        measured, and it is reached much earlier for logarithmic weight
        functions. For example, for
        {\ensuremath{\xi}}\_{\ensuremath{\pm}} on the interval 1'
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} {\ensuremath{\vartheta}} {\ensuremath{\leq}}
        400', the asymptotic limit for the parameter pair
        ({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$, {\ensuremath{\sigma}}\_8) is
        reached for 25 modes in the linear case, but already for 5 modes
        in the logarithmic case. The COSEBIs form a natural discrete set
        of quantities, which we suggest as method of choice in future
        cosmic shear likelihood analyses.}",

        understanding the dark side of the Universe. The need for
        accurate, efficient and effective methods, which are able to
        extract this information along with other cosmological
        parameters from cosmic shear data is ever growing. Complete
        Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-Integrals (COSEBIs) is a recently
        developed statistical measure that encompasses the complete
        E-/B-mode separable information contained in the shear
        correlation functions measured on a finite angular range.
        \textbackslash Aims: The aim of the present work is to test the
        properties of this newly developed statistics for a higher-
        dimensional parameter space and to generalize and test it for
        shear tomography. \textbackslash Methods: We use Fisher analysis
        to study the effectiveness of COSEBIs. We show our results in
        terms of figure-of-merit quantities, based on Fisher matrices.
        \textbackslash Results: We find that a relatively small number
        of COSEBIs modes is always enough to saturate to the maximum
        information level. This number is always smaller for
        ``logarithmic COSEBIs'' than for ``linear COSEBIs'', and also
        depends on the number of redshift bins, the number and choice of
        cosmological parameters, as well as the survey characteristics.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: COSEBIs provide a very compact way
        of analyzing cosmic shear data, i.e., all the E-/B-mode
        separable second-order statistical information in the data is
        reduced to a small number of COSEBIs modes. Furthermore, with
        this method the arbitrariness in data binning is no longer an
        issue since the COSEBIs modes are discrete. Finally, the small
        number of modes also implies that covariances, and their
        inverse, are much more conveniently obtainable, e.g., from
        numerical simulations, than for the shear correlation functions
        themselves.}",

        In Universes with less matter and larger initial density
        perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to
        accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region.
        Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region
        provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely
        insensitive to baryonic physics and provides a cleaner
        structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time,
        such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three
        publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectroscopic
        Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray
        and Sunyaev{\textendash}Zeldovich effect selected clusters in
        the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark
        Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey.
        Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near
        Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess
        surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare

        is an ongoing collaboration that will provide the largest deep
        photometric survey of the northern sky in four optical bands to
        date. As part of this collaboration, the Canada-France Imaging
        Survey (CFIS) is observing r-band data with an average seeing of
        0.65 arcsec, which is complete to magnitude 24.5 and thus ideal
        for weak-lensing studies. \textbackslash Aims: We perform the
        first weak-lensing analysis of CFIS r-band data over an area
        spanning 1700 deg$^{2}$ of the sky. We create a catalogue with
        measured shapes for 40 million galaxies, corresponding to an
        effective density of 6.8 galaxies per square arcminute, and
        demonstrate a low level of systematic biases. This work serves
        as the basis for further cosmological studies that will use the
        full UNIONS survey of 4800 deg$^{2}$ when completed.
        \textbackslash Methods: Here we present SHAPEPIPE, a newly
        developed weak-lensing pipeline. This pipeline makes use of
        state-of-the-art methods such as NGMIX for accurate galaxy shape
        measurement. Shear calibration is performed with
        metacalibration. We carry out extensive validation tests on the
        point spread function (PSF) and on the galaxy shapes. In
        addition, we create realistic image simulations to validate the
        estimated shear. \textbackslash Results: We quantify the PSF
        model accuracy and show that the level of systematics is low as
        measured by the PSF residuals. Their effect on the shear two-
        point correlation function is sub-dominant compared to the
        cosmological contribution on angular scales < 100'. The additive
        shear bias is below 5 {\texttimes} 10$^{{\ensuremath{-}}4}$, and
        the residual multiplicative shear bias is at most
        10$^{{\ensuremath{-}}3}$ as measured on image simulations. Using
        complete orthogonal sets of E-/B-mode integrals (COSEBIs), we
        show that there are no significant B-modes present in second-
        order shear statistics. We present convergence maps and see
        clear correlations of the E-mode with known cluster positions.
        We measure the stacked tangential shear profile around Planck
        clusters at a significance higher than 4{\ensuremath{\sigma}}.}",

        modeling of the foreground residuals in the spectral domain.
        This new version of the likelihood retains a larger sky fraction
        (up to 75\%) and uses an extended multipole range. Using this
        likelihood, along with low-{\ensuremath{\ell}} measurements from
        LoLLiPoP, we derived constraints on {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM
        parameters that are in good agreement with previous Planck 2018
        results, but with smaller uncertainties by 10\% to 20\%. We
        demonstrate that the foregrounds can be accurately described in
        the spectral domain, with a negligible impact on
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM parameters. We also derived
        constraints on single-parameter extensions to

        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.010, is now fully consistent with a flat
        universe and our measurement of S$_{8}$ is closer to the
        measurements derived from large-scale structure surveys (at the
        1.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} level). We also added constraints from
        PR4 lensing, making this combination the most tightly

        Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
        anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and
        polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to
        the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale
        polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured
        with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the
        precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of
        the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on
        many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated
        to affect them only at the 0.5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} level. We
        find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat
        6-parameter {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmology having a power-
        law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM'' in this paper), from polarization,
        temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A
        combined analysis gives dark matter density

        0.001, baryon density {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{b}$h$^{2}$ =
        0.0224 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0001, scalar spectral index n$_{s}$
        = 0.965 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.004, and optical depth
        {\ensuremath{\tau}} = 0.054 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.007 (in this
        abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters
        and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is
        measured to 0.03\% precision, with
        100{\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{*}$ = 1.0411 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the
        cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased
        errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the
        base-{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-
        dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H$_{0}$
        = (67.4 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$; matter
        density parameter {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ = 0.315
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude
        {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ = 0.811 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.006. We
        find no compelling evidence for extensions to the
        base-{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model. Combining with baryon
        acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-
        parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra
        relativistic degrees of freedom to be N$_{eff}$ = 2.99
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model
        prediction N$_{eff}$ = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is
        tightly constrained to
        {\ensuremath{\sum}}m$_{{\ensuremath{\nu}}}$ < 0.12 eV. The CMB
        spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than
        predicted in base {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM at over
        2{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, which pulls some parameters that affect
        the lensing amplitude away from the {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM
        model; however, this is not supported by the lensing
        reconstruction or (in models that also change the background
        geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements
        on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe,
        {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{K}$ = 0.001 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.002.
        Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy
        equation of state parameter is measured to be w$_{0}$ = -1.03
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03, consistent with a cosmological
        constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely
        power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO,
        BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-
        scalar ratio r$_{0.002}$ < 0.06. Standard big-bang
        nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium
        abundances for the base-{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM cosmology are
        in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck
        base-{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM results are in good agreement
        with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in
        slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe
        results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower
        fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in
        significant, 3.6{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, tension with local
        measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher
        value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these
        tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.}",

        a distinct post-Born observable caused by two lensing
        deflections at different redshifts (lens-lens coupling). For the
        Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the field-rotation is
        approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the CMB
        lensing convergence. Direct detection is therefore challenging
        for near-future CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory
        (SO) or CMB `Stage-4' (CMB-S4). Instead, the curl can be probed
        in cross-correlation between a direct reconstruction and a
        template formed using pairs of large-scale structure (LSS)
        tracers to emulate the lens-lens coupling. In this paper, we
        derive a new estimator for the optimal curl template
        specifically adapted for curved-sky applications, and test it
        against non-Gaussian complications using N-body cosmology
        simulations. We find non-foreground biases to the curl cross-
        spectrum are purely Gaussian at the sensitivity of SO. However,
        higher-order curl contractions induce non-Gaussian bias at the
        order of 1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} for CMB-S4 using quadratic
        estimators (QE). Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) lensing estimators
        significantly reduce biases for both SO and CMB-S4, in agreement
        with our analytic predictions. We also show that extragalactic
        foregrounds in the CMB can bias curl measurements at order of
        the signal, and evaluate a variety of mitigation strategies to
        control these biases for SO-like experiments. Near-future

        weak gravitational lensing shear using only the available
        imaging data, without need for prior information about galaxy
        properties or calibration from simulations. The method involves
        distorting the image with a small known shear, and calculating
        the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The
        method was shown to be accurate in moderate-sized simulations
        with galaxy images that had relatively high signal-to-noise
        ratios, and without significant selection effects. In this work
        we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear response and
        selection biases. We also observe that for images with
        relatively low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that
        arises during the metacalibration process results in significant
        bias, for which we develop a simple empirical correction. To
        test this formalism, we created large image simulations based on
        both parametric models and real galaxy images, including tests
        with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-
        spread function ellipticity at the five-percent level. In each
        simulation we applied a small few-percent shear to the galaxy
        images. We introduced additional challenges that arise in real
        data, such as detection thresholds, stellar contamination, and
        missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy properties
        to induce significant selection effects. Using our formalism, we

        correlations between BOSS and 2dFLenS galaxy positions and

        non-linear scales that blends perturbative and non-perturbative
        approaches, and an assessment of signal contributions by
        astrophysical effects. All weak lensing signals were measured
        consistently via Fourier-space statistics that are insensitive
        to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing. The
        calibration of photometric redshift distributions and
        multiplicative gravitational shear bias has been updated, and a
        more complete tally of residual calibration uncertainties was
        propagated into the likelihood. A dedicated suite of more than
        20 000 mocks was used to assess the performance of covariance

        highlighted to be easily misinterpreted as yielding

        estimator and associated credible interval are proposed. Known
        systematic effects pertaining to weak lensing modelling and
        inference are shown to bias S$_{8}$ by no more than 0.1 standard
        deviations, with the caveat that no conclusive validation data
        exist for models of intrinsic galaxy alignments. Compared to the
        previous KiDS analyses, S$_{8}$ constraints are expected to
        improve by 20\% for weak lensing alone and by 29\% for the joint

        one of the observational pillars on which the cosmological
        concordance model is founded. Several cosmic shear statistics
        have been developed in order to analyze data from surveys. For
        the covariances of the prevalent second-order measures we
        present simple and handy formulae, valid under the assumptions
        of Gaussian density fluctuations and a simple survey geometry.
        We also formulate these results in the context of shear
        tomography, i.e. the inclusion of redshift information, and
        generalize them to arbitrary data field geometries.
        \textbackslashMethods: We define estimators for the E- and
        B-mode projected power spectra and show them to be unbiased in
        the case of Gaussianity and a simple survey geometry. From the
        covariance of these estimators we demonstrate how to derive
        covariances of arbitrary combinations of second-order cosmic
        shear measures. We then recalculate the power spectrum
        covariance for general survey geometries and examine the bias
        thereby introduced on the estimators for exemplary
        configurations. \textbackslashResults: Our results for the
        covariances are considerably simpler than and analytically shown
        to be equivalent to the real-space approach presented in the
        first paper of this series. We find good agreement with other
        numerical evaluations and confirm the general properties of the
        covariance matrices. The studies of the specific survey
        configurations suggest that our simplified covariances may be
        employed for realistic survey geometries to good approximation.}",

        galaxy shapes and therefore accurate knowledge of the point
        spread function (PSF) model. The latter can be a source of
        systematics that affect the shear two-point correlation
        function. A key aspect of weak-lensing analysis is the
        forecasting of the systematics due to the PSF. Aims. Correlation
        functions of galaxies and the PSF, the so-called
        {\ensuremath{\rho}} and {\ensuremath{\tau}} statistics, are used
        to evaluate the level of systematics coming from the PSF model
        and PSF corrections and contributing to the two-point
        correlation function used to perform cosmological inference. Our
        goal is to introduce a fast and simple method to estimate this
        level of systematics and to assess its agreement with state-of-
        the-art approaches. Methods. We introduce a new way to estimate
        the covariance matrix of {\ensuremath{\tau}} statistics using
        analytical expressions. The covariance allows us to estimate
        parameters directly related to the level of systematics
        associated with the PSF and provides us with a tool to validate
        the PSF model used in a weak-lensing analysis. We applied these
        methods to data from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical
        Northern Survey (UNIONS). Results. We show that semi-analytical
        covariance yields results comparable to those obtained by using
        covariances obtained from simulations or jackknife resampling.
        The approach requires less computation time and is therefore
        well suited to rapid comparison of the systematic level obtained
        from different catalogues. We also show how one can break
        degeneracies between parameters with a redefinition of the
        {\ensuremath{\tau}} statistics. Conclusions. The methods
        developed in this work will be useful tools in the analysis of
        current weak-lensing data but also of Stage IV surveys such as
        Euclid, LSST, and Roman. They provide fast and accurate
        diagnostics on PSF systematics that are crucial in the context

     abstract = "{Cosmic shear, i.e. the distortion of images of high-redshift galaxies
        through the tidal gravitational field of the large-scale matter
        distribution in the Universe, offers the opportunity to measure
        the power spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations without
        any reference to the relation of dark matter to luminous
        tracers. We consider here a new statistical measure for cosmic
        shear, the aperture mass M\_ap(theta), which is defined as a
        spatially filtered projected density field and which can be
        measured directly from the image distortions of high-redshift
        galaxies. By selecting an appropriate spatial filter function,
        the dispersion of the aperture mass is a convolution of the
        power spectrum of the projected density field with a narrow
        kernel, so that <M\^2\_ap(theta)> provides a well-localized
        estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers
        s\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5/theta. We calculate
        <M\^2\_ap> for various cosmological models, using the fully non-
        linear power spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. The
        non-linear evolution yields a significant increase of <M\^2\_ap>
        relative to the linear growth on scales below
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0\^ deg\_.5. The third-order
        moment of M\_ap can be used to define a skewness, which is a
        measure of the non-Gaussianity of the density field. We present
        the first calculation of the skewness of cosmic shear in the
        framework of the quasi-linear theory of structure growth. We
        show that it yields a sensitive measure of the cosmological
        model; in particular, it is independent of the normalization of
        the power spectrum. Several practical estimates for <M\^2\_ap>
        are constructed and their dispersions calculated. On scales
        below a few arcminutes, the intrinsic ellipticity distribution
        of galaxies is the dominant source of noise, whereas on larger
        scales the cosmic variance becomes the most important
        contribution. We show that measurements of M\_ap in two adjacent
        apertures are virtually uncorrelated, which implies that an
        image with side-length L can yield [L/(2theta)]\^2 mutually
        independent estimates for M\_ap. We show that one square degree
        of a high-quality image is sufficient to detect the cosmic shear
        with the M\_ap-statistic on scales below
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10arcmin, and to estimate its
        amplitude with an accuracy of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30
        per cent on scales below
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5arcmin.}",
